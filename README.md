# Poll-App
This is a simple poll app in python(Django)
In poll application you can post a question and other will vote your options and all votes will be posted there after individual's voting.
I mainly focus on backend (ignore frontend).
#What will you get here?
1)Home screen where your question recide. 
2)After clicking on question you will get option to be voted.
3)After voting you will see all of the votes.
